# JAK DOJADĘ?

## C/C++ Project for Algorithms and Data Structures course at Gdańsk Tech Summer 2023

Project writtten for AISD course implements Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm on a graph generated based of an ascii art map.
After inputtiing, the map is analised and required data like city names, placement and roads is memorised.
The focus of this project was time optimisation and proper data managment.
